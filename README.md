# GeoHashingOnMapKit
Show markers inside a distance range using Firestore and Geohashing. 

I implemented swift version of Frank van Puffelen's great talk.

Project fetchs all marker on firestore, after show all of them on Map then create queries based on selected distance.

I also add some mvvm rules and vanilla bindable class for data binding.


Feel free to ask any question
